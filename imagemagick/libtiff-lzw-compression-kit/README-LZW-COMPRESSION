This archive will re-enable LZW compression in libtiff.  N.B. That
Unisys's position in regards to non-licenced LZW compression is clear: 

"Unisys has frequently been asked whether a Unisys license is required
in order to use LZW software obtained by downloading from the Internet
or from other sources. The answer is simple. In all cases, a written
license agreement or statement signed by an authorized Unisys
representative is required from Unisys for all use, sale or
distribution of any software (including so-called "freeware") and/or
hardware providing LZW conversion capability (for example, downloaded
software used for creating/displaying GIF images)." -- Unisys, as
quoted on http://burnallgifs.org.

Unless you are (luckily) not subject to US patent law, or have
purchaced a license from Unisys, you will be in violation of Unisys'
position when using this archive.  This archive is intended for 
authorized users only. 

INSTALLATION
------------

Edit the Makefile so that it points to the libtiff source directory, then 
run "make install".  Afterwards, go through the normal libtiff build process.
